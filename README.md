# Exploration and analysis of two infection experiments

Many parasitic worms are trophically-transmitted. That is, they are transmitted when one host is eaten by the next host. It has often been shown that worms experience 'crowding' when they share intermediate hosts. Worms tend to be smaller at higher infection intensities. But does this have consequences for the worms, like lower infection probabilit? This has been less studied. I conducted two experiments exploring this in two worm species, a nematode (*Camallanus lacustris*) and a cestode (*Schistocephalus solidus*). In both experiments, fish were infected with a constant dose of worms, but the worms were distributed differently in their intermediate hosts. Some were more crowded than others. This repository contains the data from these experiments as well as analyses of the data. Each folder contains a md file which serves as a readable report of the analyses.
