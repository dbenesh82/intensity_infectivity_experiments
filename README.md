# Exploration and analysis of two infection experiments

Many parasitic worms are trophically-transmitted. That is, they are transmitted when one host is eaten by the next host. It has often been shown that worms experience 'crowding'; they are smaller when the intermediate host is infected by multiple worms. But does this have consequences for the worms, like lower infection probability? This has been less studied. I conducted experiments exploring this in two worm species, a nematode (*Camallanus lacustris*) and a cestode (*Schistocephalus solidus*). In both experiments, fish were infected with a constant dose of worms, but the worms were distributed differently in their intermediate hosts. Some were from 'crowded' hosts and others were from 'uncrowded' hosts. This repository contains the data and analyses from these experiments. Each folder contains a md file that is a readable report of the analyses.
