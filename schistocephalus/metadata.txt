This txt file describes the data contained in the 'Schisto_double_exposure.csv'. The data are from an experiment in which stickleback fish were infected with the cestode worm Schistocephalus. All fish received 6 worms via a copepod intermediate host, but the worms were distributed differently in the intermediate hosts: one worm per copepod or two worms per copepod. The goal of the experiment was to test whether crowding (more worms per copepod) affected establishment probability in fish.

Here are descriptions of the columns.

Fish - index variable

Clutch - parasite full-sib family.

Treatment - experimental treatment. Two worms were given to fish, with either both worms in the same copepod (2+0) or worms in separate copepods (1+1).

Total Length - total fish length in mm (to end of tail fin)

Std Length - standard fish length in mm (excluding tail fin)

Fish weight - total fish weight in g, includes worm weight

Inf - the number of worms recovered upon dissection.

Sex - male or female fish.

Worm 1 - weight of first Schistocephalus worm recovered in mg.

Worm 2 - weight of second Schistocephalus worm recovered in mg.

Dead - did worm survive until dissection (0) or was it found dead (1)?

Dissected - date the fish was dissected.

Early and late exposure - there were two fish exposures, five days apart. Fish from both exposures were maintained in the same tanks, so which fish were exposed on which date cannot be determined. 

Age_at_diss1 and Age_at_diss2 - Days after exposure fish were dissected. Age_at_diss1 is if the fish was exposed on the earlier date and Age_at_diss2 is if the fish was exposed on the later date.
